### What You Should See After Cloning

After successful cloning, your `C:\DEV` folder should contain:
- `STEP1_sshKeygen.ps1`
- `STEP2_testGitLabConnection.ps1`
- `STEP3_setup-int-repo.ps1`
- `STEP4_setup-test-repo.ps1`
- `STEP5_setup-prod-repo.ps1`
- `DailyUpdate.ps1`
- `README.md`

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem: "git is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- Solution: You need to install Git first
- Go to: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Download and install Git for Windows
- ‚úÖ **Important:** During installation, make sure "Git Bash Here" is selected
- Restart your computer and try again

**Problem: Don't see "Git Bash Here" in right-click menu**
- Solution: Git for Windows isn't installed or wasn't installed with context menu integration
- Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- During installation, make sure these options are checked:
  - ‚úÖ "Windows Explorer integration"
  - ‚úÖ "Git Bash Here"
  - ‚úÖ "Git GUI Here"
- Restart your computer after installation

**Problem: "Access denied" or permission errors**
- Solution: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- Right-click on PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
- Alternative: Use Git Bash instead (usually has fewer permission issues)

**Problem: Can't find the cloned files**
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`C:\DEV`)
- The `.` at the end of the clone command is important - it means "clone into current folder"
- If files are in a subfolder, move them up to `C:\DEV` directly

**Problem: Git Bash window closes immediately**
- This is normal after the download completes
- Just check your `C:\DEV` folder - the files should be there
- If nothing downloaded, try running the command again

### Ready to Continue?
Once you see all the `.ps1` files in your `C:\DEV` folder, you're ready to proceed to the next section!
